# Project_Mcnulty
Third project at Metis Data Science Bootcamp

## Worklist
Here is my checklist of things to do:
* StandardScaler on all numerical columns, merge back in
* Balance dataset (either undersample or oversample)
* Check correlation of features vs target
* Run balanced training data on pipeline of all models
* Remove damage as features
* Check confusion matrix
* F-beta score to make sure false negatives are highlighted
* PCA
* Lasso Regression
* Hyperparameter tuning and check best for each model
* kfold Cross Validation and learning curves
* ROC/AUC
