# Project_Mcnulty
Third project at Metis Data Science Bootcamp

## Worklist
Here is my checklist of things to do:
* StandardScaler on all numerical columns, merge back in
* Balance dataset (either undersample or oversample)
* Check correlation of features vs target
* Lasso Regression
* Hyperparameter tuning and check best for each model
* kfold Cross Validation and learning curves
* ROC/AUC

## Priorities

1. Scrape baseball-reference
2. Clean data
3. EDA
4. Find features
5. Cross validate models and run learning curves
6. Retrain model and run on final test set
7. Push final project repo to "student_submissions/projects/project_luther" under a new branch off the master -- create a directory there, and add the files
